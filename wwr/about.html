            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In the 1950s, Rockefeller used surplus military rafts to offer float trips at his Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park. The first year, fewer than 500 people went on the trips, but demand increased. This attraction was initially considered a failure, but it reflected growing interest in rafting, which led to the continued development of the sport as a commercial attraction.</p>
